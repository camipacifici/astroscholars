    "A computer program is usually written by a computer programmer in a programming language. From the program in its human-readable form of source code, a **compiler** or assembler can derive machine codeâ€”a form consisting of instructions that the computer can directly execute. Alternatively, a computer program may be executed with the aid of an **interpreter**.\n",

    "A collection of computer programs, libraries, and related data are referred to as **software**. Computer programs may be categorized along functional lines, such as application software and system software. The underlying method used for some calculation or manipulation is known as an **algorithm**."
